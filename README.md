Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking "X" or "O" in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching symbols. The game includes logic to check for a winner after every move and displays the result (win, lose, or draw) at the end of each round. The interface is user-friendly, with a reset button to start a new game.
